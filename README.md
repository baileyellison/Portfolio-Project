# Bailey's Portfolio

## Description
In the process of becoming a full-stack developer, it is essential to have a portfolio website which showcases the ability of the developer. This portfolio is a demonstration of my professional work this far along with my personality as a growing developer. The user will be able to access this portfolio through Netflify. In order to use the web application with ease, click on any of the pages seen in the navigation bar. At the footer, icons with GitHub, LinkedIn and personal email appear. Projects are linked within the portfolio page with their deployed and repository links respectively attached.
